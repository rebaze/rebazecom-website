As of today, Rebaze is proud to become a member at the OSGi Alliance.

Since its inception, Rebaze is committed to helping software development teams making better software. OSGi as a technology is the only proven runtime level module system for the Java Platform.

Migrating to OSGi is not an easy task. Its usually a painful task. But it is worth the effort as it tells you exactly how good or bad your architecture really is. On the other hand, chosing OSGi as a technology to start with is also full of possible pitfalls.  There are many way of how to actually use OSGi. Go OSGi-first or embedd the OSGi as a plugin kernel into another JEE Container ? How to actually develop and test bundles ?

As a Contributing Associate Member, Rebaze is able to participate in specification discussions helping making OSGi easier to adopt and more useful to the enterprise software project.
